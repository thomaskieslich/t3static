# t3static
Collection of Tools to Test, Lint, Fix and Upgrade multiple TYPO3 Extensions in a Monorepo.
The rules are simple to bring the code in the individual extensions up to the same level.

This is to have the most uniform code standards possible for projects with many custom extensions.
It should also be possible to recognise and fix simple problems in the code.
Use in continuous integration pipelines should be possible.
A special goal of this tool collection is to test TYPO3 extensions without great effort and adjustments in the code.
This Tool have its own node_modules and vendor Settings and Folders.
